# Predicting-Concrete-Compressive-Strength-with-Regression
Demonstrate linear regression modelling applied towards predicting the compressive strength of concrete

BACKGROUND:

-Compressive strength is the capacity of a material or structure to withstand loads tending to reduce size, as opposed to tensile strength, which withstands loads tending to elongate.

-The concrete compressive strength is a highly non-linear function of age and ingredients .These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.

-The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. 


PROBLEM STATEMENT: 

-Based on values of components of concrete mixtures, can we predict the compressive strength of concrete? 

MODELS TESTED:

-Simple Linear Regression – predicting Compressive Strength (CCS) based on ‘Cement’

-Multivariable Linear Regression, drawing features from optimal correlations

-Multivariable linear regression, with manually selected features

-Random Forest 

-Simple Logistic Regression – predicting whether concrete is cured or fresh.
